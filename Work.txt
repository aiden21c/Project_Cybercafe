1. How to disconect a given IP from router on demand.
2. get router to scan blacklist for ip adresses, then kick those when trying to connect or already connected.
3. Add adress to blacklist when over allocated data limit - Theory, no need to add in actuall functionality - Make it a hard cap that can't be changed to start with.
4. Add abillity to change data settings
4. Link Ip adresses to accounts, then blacklist all IP based on the accounts associated with them.
