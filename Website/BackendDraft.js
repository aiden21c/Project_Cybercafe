// This file is incomplete version of the backend code for the portal.
// It is used to demonstrate the functionality of the portal.
// The code is not complete and is not meant to be used in production.

// 1. Disconnect a given IP from router on demand.
function disconnectIp(ip) {
    // code to disconnect the given IP from router
    // assuming the router object is available and has a function to disconnect the IP
    router.disconnectIP(ip);
}

// 2. Scan blacklist for IP addresses and kick those when trying to connect or already connected.
function scanAndKick() {
    // code to scan blacklist for IP addresses and disconnect them
    // assuming the router object is available and has a function to scan and kick the IPs
    router.scanAndKickBlacklist();
}

// 3. Add address to blacklist when over allocated data limit.
function addToBlacklist(ip) {
    // code to add the given IP address to the blacklist
    // assuming the blacklist object is available and has a function to add IP addresses
    blacklist.add(ip);
}

// 4. Ability to change data settings
function changeDataSettings(newSettings) {
    // code to change data settings
    // assuming the router object is available and has a function to change data settings
    router.changeDataSettings(newSettings);
}

// 5. Link IP addresses to accounts, then blacklist all IPs based on the accounts associated with them.
function linkIpToAccount(ip, account) {
    // code to link the given IP address to the given account
    // assuming the account object is available and has a function to link IP addresses
    account.linkIP(ip);
    // assuming the blacklist object is available and has a function to blacklist all IPs based on the account
    blacklist.blacklistByAccount(account);
}

// example usage:
// disconnect IP 192.168.1.100
disconnectIp("192.168.1.100");

// scan and kick IP addresses in the blacklist
scanAndKick();

// add IP address 192.168.1.200 to the blacklist
addToBlacklist("192.168.1.200");

// change data settings to new values
changeDataSettings({ limit: 1000, speed: "fast" });

// link IP address 192.168.1.100 to account "user1"
linkIpToAccount("192.168.1.100", "user1");
